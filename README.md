# ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The model was built using Logistic Regression, a widely-used algorithm for binary classification problems.

## üìå Objective

To develop a predictive model that can help in early detection of heart disease, potentially aiding healthcare providers in timely intervention and treatment planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- ST depression (oldpeak)
- Exercise-induced angina
- And more...

## üîç Process Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations for insight

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression for binary classification

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix

üìà Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved good performance with high accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for medical applications where transparency is important.
